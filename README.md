# Python Plagiarism Detector

This is a basic external plagiarism detector that has two features: 
1. Compare a single document against a group of documents (that goes by the name of "corpus") and list the most similar documents within the corpus. Sorting by descendant order based on the plagiarism percentage of every similar document.
2. Check which paragraphs are similar against a single suspicious document. This includes a plagiarism percentage to show the similarity between the suspicious paragraph and the original paragraph.
